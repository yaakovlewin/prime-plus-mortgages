# Firebase Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Prime Plus Mortgages application and provides instructions for setup and deployment.

## Security Features Implemented

1. **Authentication Service**

   - Email/Password authentication for admin users
   - Session management
   - Admin role verification
   - Protected routes using Next.js middleware

2. **Firebase Security**

   - Firestore security rules for data protection
   - Environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - App Check implementation with existing reCAPTCHA

3. **API Protection**
   - Protected API routes (/admin, /api/application, /api/contact, /api/content)
   - Rate limiting
   - Token verification

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Variables**

   - All necessary environment variables are configured in `.env.local` file

2. **Firebase Security Rules Deployment**

   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
   npm install -g firebase-tools

   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login

   # Deploy security rules
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

3. **Admin User Setup**
   To set up an admin user:
   1. Create a user through Firebase Authentication
   2. Use Firebase Admin SDK to set admin claims:
   ```javascript
   admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, { admin: true });
   ```

## Security Rules Overview

1. **Applications Collection**

   - Read: Admin or document owner only
   - Create: Public access (for application form submissions)
   - Update/Delete: Admin only

2. **Contacts Collection**

   - Read: Admin only
   - Create: Public access (for contact form submissions)
   - Update/Delete: Admin only

3. **Content Collection**
   - Read: Public access
   - Write: Admin only

## Protected Routes

The following routes are protected by middleware:

- `/admin/*` - Admin access only
- `/api/application/*` - Authenticated access
- `/api/contact/*` - Protected endpoints
- `/api/content/*` - Protected endpoints

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**

   - Never commit `.env.local` to version control
   - Keep production secrets secure
   - Regularly rotate sensitive credentials

2. **Authentication**

   - Use strong passwords for admin accounts
   - Implement password policies
   - Monitor failed login attempts

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting is configured for public endpoints
   - All API routes verify authentication tokens
   - Sensitive operations require admin privileges

## Monitoring

1. **Security Monitoring**

   - Monitor Firebase Authentication logs
   - Track failed login attempts
   - Review API usage patterns

2. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Keep Firebase SDK updated
   - Review security rules periodically
   - Update dependencies for security patches

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Deploy Firestore security rules
- [ ] Test protected routes
- [ ] Verify admin access
- [ ] Check rate limiting configuration
- [ ] Test API endpoints security
- [ ] Monitor initial deployment for any security alerts
